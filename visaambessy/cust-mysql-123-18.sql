To get your free visa assessment, get in touch with Global-Migrate today.<br><br>\r\nThe Skilled Independent Visa has some basic requirements, including an English language requirement and an age limit of 50 years old. To apply for the visa, you will need to submit an expression of interest, in which you provide information about your occupation.<br>\r\n<a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="free-assessment.php"></a></p><div class="more"></div>\r\n<br>\r\nAustralia’s Skilled Occupation List includes details of the types of occupations that are eligible for the subclass 189 visa. Global-Migrate can help you determine if your occupation is included in the list. You will also need to have a skill assessment to determine if your skills within that occupation are suitable.<br><br>\r\nAlthough you will need to prove your ability, the Subclass 189 visa can be a great opportunity for you to live and work in Australia. To find out about the requirements for a particular occupation, and to find out how to maximise your chances of getting approved for this type of visa, call Global-Migrate’s MARA regulated advisors.<br><br>\r\nOnce your expression of interest is approved, you’ll be invited to apply for the Skilled Independent Visa.

To apply for the visa, you will need to submit an expression of interest, in which you provide information about your occupation.<br>\r\n<a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="free-assessment.php"></a></p><div class="more"></div>\r\n<br>\r\nAustralia’s Skilled Occupation List includes details of the types of occupations that are eligible for the subclass 189 visa. Global-Migrate can help you determine if your occupation is included in the list. You will also need to have a skill assessment to determine if your skills within that occupation are suitable.<br><br>\r\nAlthough you will need to prove your ability, the Subclass 189 visa can be a great opportunity for you to live and work in Australia. To find out about the requirements for a particular occupation, and to find out how to maximise your chances of getting approved for this type of visa, call Global-Migrate’s MARA regulated advisors.<br><br>\r\nOnce your expression of interest is approved, you’ll be invited to apply for the Skilled Independent Visa. The visa can allow you, and a spouse, to travel freely to Australia for up to five years. If you are interested in applying for this visa, get in touch with us today.<br><br>\r\nWith years of skilled migration experience, Global-Migrate’s consultants are able to help you find the best path for your migration.

The country’s points-based visa system allows certain skilled workers to gain permanent residency. One of the visas in this program is the Skilled Nominated, or subclass 190, Visa.<br><br>\r\nIf you are thinking of applying for a Skilled Nominated Visa, get in touch with Global-Migrate today for a free visa assessment. Our qualified advisors can help determine if this is the right visa for you.<br><br>\r\nAs with all of Australia’s skilled worker visas, the subclass 190 visa does have some basic requirements. These include an English language requirement as well as an age requirement. If you’re under 50 and have the language ability, you can submit an expression of interest for a subclass 190 visa.<br>\r\n <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="free-assessment.php"> </a></p><div class="more"></div>\r\n <br>\r\nLike the other skilled worker visas, you will need to pass the points assessment for the Skilled Nominated visa. To find out about what can earn you points, and how many points you’ll need, speak to Global-Migrate’s MARA registered consultants. We have helped many people with their skilled immigration applications, and can help you with yours.<br><br>\r\nFor the Skilled Nominated visa, you will also need a state or territory nomination. Some states and territories are in need of specific types of skilled workers. If you receive a nomination, you will need to settle in that state or territory. If you want to find out about the benefits, and limits, of a nomination speak to a Global-Migrate representative today.<br><br>\r\nThe subclass 190 visa can be a great way to migrate to Australia. If you qualify, it can give you and your spouse the ability to take up permanent residency in Australia, and can put you on the path to citizenship.<br><br>\r\nOf course, as with any visa application, the Australian subclass 190 visa process can be confusing. Working with an experienced immigration advisor like global-Migrate can help ensure you’re submitting your application correctly.

Like the other visas in this system, you must demonstrate knowledge of the English language, and you must be under 50 years old.<br><br>\r\nGlobal-Migrate’s MARA regulated immigration advisors have helped many people with their skilled migrant visas. To receive your free visa assessment, get in touch today. We can help determine in the subclass 489 visa is right for you.<br><br>\r\nTo qualify for this visa, you must also have sponsorship from a relative in Australia. The Skilled Regional visa is aimed at certain Designated Areas of Australia. Your family member must live in one of these areas. To find out what relatives can sponsor you, and where they must live, get in touch with Global-Migrate for the most up-to-date information.<br>\r\n <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="free-assessment.php"> </a></p><div class="more"></div>\r\n <br>\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can apply on the basis of a nomination from a participating state or territory government. For more information about this path, and how to get a nomination, call Global-Migrate’s advisors today.<br><br>\r\nOur consultants can also give you guidance about the application process. For the subclass 489 visa, you will need to first submit an expression of interest, in which you will need to give information about your occupation and your skill level. Global-Migrate can help you with your Expression of Interest, and can help you find out about what occupations are in demand in Australia.<br><br>\r\nThe 489 visa can be a great option for living and working in Australia. While you will need to stay in the specific area of your sponsorship or nomination during the first part of your visa, you will be eligible to apply for permanent residency after two years. When this is granted, you will be free to live and work in any part of Australia.<br><br>\r\nThe Skilled Nominated or Sponsored Provisional Visa can be the ideal way for you to migrate to Australia.

This is a points based application and you need to score a minimum of a 100 pints based on your age, education, language and work experience.

Like any immigration process, getting a Demark Greencard can be a very complex and daunting process. If you want help with your application, get in touch with Global-Migrate’s trained immigration consultants. We have helped many people apply for, and get, their Green Cards.\r\n\r\nThe Greencard scheme is a points-based system. Points are earned for the level of education you have attained, along with bonus points for top ranked universities. You can also earn additional points if you are qualified to work in certain fields. Regardless of field, you will also earn points for your recent work experience.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about which fields can earn you the most points, or to find out how many points your education will earn, get in touch with Global-Migrate today.\r\n\r\nYou will also be given points for your language skills. While knowledge of Danish can be important for your success in Denmark, you might also be eligible for points for your knowledge of other languages, including English and German.\r\n\r\nIt is important to make sure your application for a Greencard includes all the information and documentation required, including proof of your financial resources and health insurance. If you do not provide the right information, your application can be rejected. By using a trusted immigration advisor like Global-Migrate, you can be confident your application will be complete and successful.\r\n\r\nWhen you get your Greencard, you will be able to live and work in Denmark for up to three years, with the ability to extend your stay for up to five additional years.

This is a points based application and you need to score a minimum of a 100 pints based on your age, education, language and work experience. A residence permit under the Greencard scheme gives you the right to carry out paid or unpaid work.

It can be stressful to migrate to the UK for study, though, which is where we come in. We work with the top UK universities and UKBA approved colleges to help students relocate, and have done for the past 15 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe UK is the second most popular destination, after the US, for student visas, and more than 3,000 institutions welcome international undergraduates and graduates.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nTo successfully receive a UK Tier 4 student visa, and a university place, you may be asked to sit an English Language Test. The most common are IELTS or TOEFL tests. These assess you to see whether you would learn effectively in an English institution. The IELTS is organised by the British Council. Results take two to three weeks and the minimum scores are usually 6.0 for the IELTS and 550 for the TOEFL.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nFor certain post-graduate studies you will need a good GMAT score (Graduate Management Admission Test). This is in addition to the IELTS/TOEFL scores and you also need two to three years’ work experience, as well as a fair academic performance in your original degree.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nUndergraduate courses cost approximately £7,000 for Arts, £8,000 for Sciences and between £7,000 and £18,000 for medial programmes. Universities do set their own fees, though, which vary per subject and institution. For postgraduate study you should budget for a 12-month academic year.\r\nInternational students staying in the UK for six months or more qualify for free National Health Service (NHS) care as well. Those staying for a shorter period of time can get an EU healthcare card to prove eligibility for treatment and arrange payment at a later date.\r\n</p><h4>Eligibility </h4>\r\nAdult students applying to study in the UK must have recognised qualifications equivalent to the National Qualification Framework (NQF) in the UK education system.

It can be stressful to migrate to the UK for study, though, which is where we come in. We work with the top UK universities and UKBA approved colleges to help students relocate, and have done for the past 15 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe UK is the second most popular destination, after the US, for student visas, and more than 3,000 institutions welcome international undergraduates and graduates.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nTo successfully receive a UK Tier 4 student visa, and a university place, you may be asked to sit an English Language Test. The most common are IELTS or TOEFL tests. These assess you to see whether you would learn effectively in an English institution. The IELTS is organised by the British Council. Results take two to three weeks and the minimum scores are usually 6.0 for the IELTS and 550 for the TOEFL.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nFor certain post-graduate studies you will need a good GMAT score (Graduate Management Admission Test). This is in addition to the IELTS/TOEFL scores and you also need two to three years’ work experience, as well as a fair academic performance in your original degree.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nUndergraduate courses cost approximately £7,000 for Arts, £8,000 for Sciences and between £7,000 and £18,000 for medial programmes. Universities do set their own fees, though, which vary per subject and institution. For postgraduate study you should budget for a 12-month academic year.\r\nInternational students staying in the UK for six months or more qualify for free National Health Service (NHS) care as well. Those staying for a shorter period of time can get an EU healthcare card to prove eligibility for treatment and arrange payment at a later date.\r\n</p><h4>Eligibility </h4>\r\nAdult students applying to study in the UK must have recognised qualifications equivalent to the National Qualification Framework (NQF) in the UK education system. They must also produce evidence they have sufficient funds to meet the maintenance requirement and the documents used to get a university or college offer initially.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nA visa letter from the education provider is most important in the points-based assessment process, while showing proof of maintenance funds to cover course fees and living expenses will also contribute to the points tally.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nFor more assistance with the involved task of moving to study please use our FREE online assessment tool.

This visa allows you to come to the UK for up to six months before your wedding or civil partnership provided you intend to settle in the UK after it.<br><br>\r\nIf you aren’t sure this is the right category for you, call Global Migrate for help. Our advisors can help you determine which visa category fits your situation.<br><br>\r\nFor a fiancé visa, you and your fiancé must both be over 18 and legally allowed to marry each other. You must have met each other in person, and your relationship must be genuine. You must also demonstrate that you meet certain financial and language requirements.<br><br>\r\nYou will not be allowed to work while in the UK on a fiancé visa, and you must show that you and your partner will be able to support yourselves and any children during this time.<br><br>\r\nThe UK Border Agency provides guidance on how to prove all of this, but for advice about your specific situation, it’s best to speak to a trained immigration adviser at Global Migrate.<br><br>\r\nAs with all UK visas, you’ll also need to meet suitability criteria. These guidelines focus on things like criminal records, past immigration, and similar issues. You will also need to prove that you and your fiancé have suitable accommodation, and that you live together.<br><br>\r\nIf you have been denied a fiancé visa, you have the ability to appeal.

This visa allows you to come to the UK for up to six months before your wedding or civil partnership provided you intend to settle in the UK after it.<br><br>\r\nIf you aren’t sure this is the right category for you, call Global Migrate for help. Our advisors can help you determine which visa category fits your situation.<br><br>\r\nFor a fiancé visa, you and your fiancé must both be over 18 and legally allowed to marry each other. You must have met each other in person, and your relationship must be genuine. You must also demonstrate that you meet certain financial and language requirements.<br><br>\r\nYou will not be allowed to work while in the UK on a fiancé visa, and you must show that you and your partner will be able to support yourselves and any children during this time.<br><br>\r\nThe UK Border Agency provides guidance on how to prove all of this, but for advice about your specific situation, it’s best to speak to a trained immigration adviser at Global Migrate.<br><br>\r\nAs with all UK visas, you’ll also need to meet suitability criteria. These guidelines focus on things like criminal records, past immigration, and similar issues. You will also need to prove that you and your fiancé have suitable accommodation, and that you live together.<br><br>\r\nIf you have been denied a fiancé visa, you have the ability to appeal. Most refusals are because the proper evidence has not been submitted.

The investment fund requirement is set at £200,000, in some cases, or £50,000, in other cases. The specific requirements do change frequently, which is why an immigration advisor such as Global-Migrate is so important.<br><br>\r\nFor the language requirements, you must demonstrate sufficient knowledge of English. To be successful in your application, you’ll also need a maintenance fund to support yourself and any dependents that is separate from the investment money.<br><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why get help?</strong><br><br>\r\nA Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa can be a great way to enter the UK for business purposes. It gives you access to one of the world’s strongest economies. However, applying for this type of visa is very complicated. To be able to demonstrate that you meet the requirements, you will need to provide significant documentation, too.<br><br>\r\nOne of the biggest reasons for visa refusal is people doing it on their own and not sending the correct information. The best way to avoid this is to use the services of Global-Migrate’s trained and qualified experts.

The permit grants them a UK visa on the basis that they have a job offer and meet a number of skill requirements.<p></p>\r\n<p>At Global-Migrate we provide a tailor made service designed to assist these highly skilled individuals to get a successful outcome of their visa.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits of a Tier 2 visa</h4>\r\nTier 2 immigration is a UK visa which offers a possibility of permanent residency in the UK to highly skilled foreign nationals. It allows large organisations to transfer the skills of new and existing staff members from outside the UK into this country.<p></p>\r\n<p>The Tier 2 work permit visas can last between one day and five years, depending on the time frame specified by the sponsoring company. Although the Tier 2 permit is not a permanent residency visa, those who do live and work in the UK for a minimum of five years on this permit may apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK. Once they have completed a year on the ILR category they may be eligible for British Citizenship through the Naturalisation route</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThis application is a point’s based visa. Tier 2 visa applicants are assessed based on potential Earnings, English language skills and available funds to support their stay in the UK.<p></p>\r\n<p>It is the employer’s responsibility to make sure that a candidate is eligible and suitable. Immigration compliance checks can be carried out and require no notice. Employers will be awarded a sponsorship license, according to the UK Border Agency’s risk assessment.

However, candidates can change their employment whilst in the UK, but they must obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship once again and they must be reassessed against the points test.<p></p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Duration</h4>\r\nThe change of employer requires a new sponsorship, therefore it is classified as a new permit and means you can work for a period of one to five years all over again, depending on the sponsor’s contract offer duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>The duration is also at the discretion of the Home Office and these changes are temporary immigration services, not a route to settlement. Settlement can be pursued after five years, though. Due to the temporary nature, you do not have the freedom to work in the UK aside this agreed role.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThe position for which the change of employment working visa is being sought must meet National Vocation Qualification (NVQ) level 3 or above, as the original application for a Tier 2 permit did. If the candidate in question works in a specific profession, they may be required to register with the relevant governing body.<p></p>\r\n<p>A candidate applying for a permit to work in the UK must possess a relevant degree or a non-relevant degree plus a year’s experience. The same can apply to a HND level qualification and again, if irrelevant then there must be a year’s relevant work experience alongside it. A candidate can be eligible with no degree if they have three years of relevant experience.</p>\r\n<p>If a position is listed on the UK shortage list then the employer does not need to advertise the vacancy before sponsoring an applicant. They must prove an attempt to recruit from within the UK and EU workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Global-Migrate can help make sure that your company abides by all the relevant rules and regulations in applying for a Tier 2 permit.

We have fifteen years of experience in the immigration industry, and regularly help those looking to hire migrant workers.

If you are interested in this type of license, call our specialist advisors.<br><br>\r\nFor a business sponsorship license, you will need to meet a set of requirements. These include human resources systems that keep the proper records for migrant workers. You must also provide documentation of many aspects of your business, including some that might be specific to your industry.<br><br>\r\nAll evidence must be supplied within ten days of the initial online application, so it is important that you have everything prepared when you apply. Global-Migrate’s specialist case workers can help you prepare your application.<br><br>\r\nOnce approved, licensed sponsors will be given a rating of either A or B. both ratings allow licensees to sponsor migrants, but a B rating means that the organisation is working with the UK Border Agency to improve their systems.<br><br>\r\nBecause a license allows an organisation to sponsor migrants to come into the UK for work, they are very carefully monitored. If a sponsoring organisation is in breach of any immigration laws, they can face a significant fine and prison sentence. If a sponsor has issued a sponsorship certificate in error, all of the non-EU people they have sponsored may be forced to stop work and could be given 28 days to leave the UK.<br><br>\r\nBecoming a licensed sponsor is a big step. The process can be difficult, but the rewards are great. If you’re thinking about becoming a Tier 2 sponsor, get in touch with Global-Migrate today.

Global-Migrate’s specialist case workers can help you prepare your application.<br><br>\r\nOnce approved, licensed sponsors will be given a rating of either A or B. both ratings allow licensees to sponsor migrants, but a B rating means that the organisation is working with the UK Border Agency to improve their systems.<br><br>\r\nBecause a license allows an organisation to sponsor migrants to come into the UK for work, they are very carefully monitored. If a sponsoring organisation is in breach of any immigration laws, they can face a significant fine and prison sentence. If a sponsor has issued a sponsorship certificate in error, all of the non-EU people they have sponsored may be forced to stop work and could be given 28 days to leave the UK.<br><br>\r\nBecoming a licensed sponsor is a big step. The process can be difficult, but the rewards are great. If you’re thinking about becoming a Tier 2 sponsor, get in touch with Global-Migrate today. We’ll provide you with a free initial assessment of your application.<br><br>\r\n\r\n </p></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <td align="left">  <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="free-assessment.php"> <div class="more"></div></a></td>\r\n                  <td align="right"><table width="157" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0">\r\n          <tbody><tr>\r\n             <td width="10">&nbsp;</td> \r\n            <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td width="36"></td>\r\n            <td width="34"></td>\r\n            <td width="41"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </tbody></table></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </table>', 'Tier 2 - Sponsorship Licence', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '179-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-12-05 13:07:55', '2013-12-05 13:07:55', '', 179, 'http://creativewebdesignlondon.com/global-migrat/?p=180', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Call Global-Migrate to find out what rules will be used to judge your application, and to get an assessment of your case.<br><br>\r\nThe current immigration rules will allow settlement after 10 years of continuous lawful residence. This means that you will have to have been in the UK for that period of time, and that you did not breach the terms of your visa at any point. You must also meet language and life requirements, as you would for any settlement visa.<br><br>\r\nIf you have been in the UK for 10 years, there is no limit as to when you can apply for settlement. After 10 years you become eligible, and remain eligible. However, your case will be judged by the rules in effect at the time of your application. If you wait to apply, the rules are subject to change.<br><br>\r\nGlobal-Migrate helps hundreds of people every year who want to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom. Our team of experienced advisors can help you figure out if your application will be successful. If we believe your application will be successful, we can help you through the entire application process.<br><br>\r\nTo find out more about long term residency, and the current requirements, get in touch with us today.\r\n</p></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <td align="left">  <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="free-assessment.php"> <div class="more"></div></a></td>\r\n                  <td align="right"><table width="157" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0">\r\n          <tbody><tr>\r\n             <td width="10">&nbsp;</td> \r\n            <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td width="36"></td>\r\n            <td width="34"></td>\r\n            <td width="41"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </tbody></table></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </table>', 'Long Term Residency', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '193-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-12-05 13:13:15', '2013-12-05 13:13:15', '', 193, 'http://creativewebdesignlondon.com/global-migrat/?p=194', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

If you aren’t sure whether your country is part of the Visa Waiver Program, or if you aren’t eligible for it, get in touch with Global-Migrate’s immigration experts. We can help you determine what visa will be required for your visit to the United States.<br><br>\r\nTo be approved for a B-2 visa, you will need to prove that you do not intend to immigrate to the US during your travels. In order to prove this, you will need to show things like your ability to pay for your time in the US, your ties to a non-US location, including a job, family, and home, and your return travel.<br><br>\r\nThe evidence you provide will help the immigration officials process your visa application. Global-Migrate can help you prepare your application, including the embassy interview, which can improve your chance of success.<br><br>\r\nOnce your B-2 visa is approved, you will be able to enter the United States. While there, though, you will not be able to take on work, or study towards a degree. To find out about the special visas for these or other purposes, speak to a Global-Migrate advisor.<br><br>\r\nThe United States has many things to offer visitors, and getting a B-2 visa can allow you to enjoy everything the country is famous for. Whether you’re planning travel to the skyscrapers of New York, the beaches of California, or someplace in between, speak to one of Global-Migrate’s qualified advisors today to help make your American travel dreams come true.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     </p>\r\n                   </td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <td align="left">  <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="free-assessment.php"> <div class="more"></div></a></td>\r\n                  <td align="right"><table width="157" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0">\r\n          <tbody><tr>\r\n             <td width="10">&nbsp;</td> \r\n            <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td width="36"></td>\r\n            <td width="34"></td>\r\n            <td width="41"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </tbody></table></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </table>', 'USA B2 Visa', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '207-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-12-05 13:20:20', '2013-12-05 13:20:20', '', 207, 'http://creativewebdesignlondon.com/global-migrat/?p=208', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This visa is designed for intracompany transfers and can allow you to work for your employer in a managerial or other specialised position.<br><br>\r\nTo find out if the L-1 visa is right for you, and to get help with your application, speak to one of Global-Migrate’s qualified immigration advisors today.<br><br>\r\nIn general, your company needs to be doing business in the United States as well as another country, and intend to continue doing so. As an employee, you need to have been working for such a qualifying company for one continuous year within the three years prior to relocating to the US.<br><br>\r\nLike other non-immigrant visas, you will be limited to a certain amount of time in the US. However, with an L-1 visa you will be able to bring certain family members with you. To find out which family members can travel with you, and what limits they will have on their stay, call Global-Migrate today.<br><br>\r\nAnother difference between the L-1 visa and some other non-immigrant visas is that you will not be required to maintain a foreign residence while you are in the US. You will also be able to apply for permanent residency, meaning you’ll be able to remain in the US even after the period of your L-1 visa is up.<br><br>\r\nThe benefits of relocating to the US through an L-1 visa are great. It can allow you to migrate while keeping your existing job, and lacks many of the limitations of other employer-based visas.

As migration agents we completely understand that migration to Australia is not just a lengthy process but also complicated. However, with many years or practice and experience we fully understand the standard of work required in your application process for a successful application. It’s not just about complying with all the regulations, it’s as much about presenting the facts of your case in the right way to ensure that your application gets through the system the first time you apply. As a company that hires MARA registered agents we are bound by a strict code of conduct for your protection <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.mara.gov.au/Code-of-Conduct/Code-of-Conduct/default.aspx">(MARA Code of Conduct)</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n                  Covering a total area of 7.69 million square kilometers, mainland Australia is the world’s largest island &ndash; but smallest continent.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAustralia is also the only continent that is governed as a single country. It is sometimes informally referred to as an ‘island’ continent, surrounded by oceans.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMost Australians are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants who arrived during the past two hundred years from more than 200 countries. The most commonly spoken language in Australia is English, and the most commonly practiced religion is Christianity, although foreign languages and other religions are also common.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAustralian Immigration can be quite a complex and a time consuming process, therefore, we strongly advise you to seek assistance from people in the know how. A regulated consultancy who hires a MARA agent like us is definitely a good option. This reduces the chance of a rejection in your visa application and most definitely is a wise decision if you are deciding to make a life changing decision for a better future for you and your family.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nYou may apply for immigration to Australia via many different routes.

As migration agents we completely understand that migration to Australia is not just a lengthy process but also complicated. However, with many years or practice and experience we fully understand the standard of work required in your application process for a successful application.

As a company that hires MARA registered agents we are bound by a strict code of conduct for your protection <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.mara.gov.au/Code-of-Conduct/Code-of-Conduct/default.aspx">(MARA Code of Conduct)</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n                  Covering a total area of 7.69 million square kilometers, mainland Australia is the world’s largest island &ndash; but smallest continent.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAustralia is also the only continent that is governed as a single country. It is sometimes informally referred to as an ‘island’ continent, surrounded by oceans.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMost Australians are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants who arrived during the past two hundred years from more than 200 countries. The most commonly spoken language in Australia is English, and the most commonly practiced religion is Christianity, although foreign languages and other religions are also common.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAustralian Immigration can be quite a complex and a time consuming process, therefore, we strongly advise you to seek assistance from people in the know how. A regulated consultancy who hires a MARA agent like us is definitely a good option. This reduces the chance of a rejection in your visa application and most definitely is a wise decision if you are deciding to make a life changing decision for a better future for you and your family.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nYou may apply for immigration to Australia via many different routes.

The exact amount of time will depend on your current visa category. For people living in the UK as the married spouse or civil partner of a British citizen, you will need to be resident for three years. To check the residence requirement for your case, call Global-Migrate for more information and a free assessment.<br><br>\r\nThe citizenship application includes requirements that are not found in visa applications. You will need to be of sound mind, meaning you are able to make your own decisions.<br><br>\r\nFor anyone over 10 years of age who is not stateless, you will need to demonstrate good character. This includes acting lawfully and paying taxes. Your criminal background will also be checked, and you will be asked about participation in any war crimes or genocide.<br><br>\r\nIf you are considering making an application for British citizenship, it is highly recommended that you speak to an immigration advisor first. With fifteen years of experience, Global-Migrate is a leading expert in immigration, and we can help you with your citizenship application.<br><br>\r\nWe work with hundreds of applicants every year, and our highly trained case workers keep up to date with all the changing immigration regulations.

If you want help with your application, get in touch with Global-Migrate’s trained immigration consultants. We have helped many people apply for, and get, their Green Cards.\r\n\r\nThe Greencard scheme is a points-based system.

You can also earn additional points if you are qualified to work in certain fields. Regardless of field, you will also earn points for your recent work experience.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about which fields can earn you the most points, or to find out how many points your education will earn, get in touch with Global-Migrate today.\r\n\r\nYou will also be given points for your language skills. While knowledge of Danish can be important for your success in Denmark, you might also be eligible for points for your knowledge of other languages, including English and German.\r\n\r\nIt is important to make sure your application for a Greencard includes all the information and documentation required, including proof of your financial resources and health insurance. If you do not provide the right information, your application can be rejected. By using a trusted immigration advisor like Global-Migrate, you can be confident your application will be complete and successful.\r\n\r\nWhen you get your Greencard, you will be able to live and work in Denmark for up to three years, with the ability to extend your stay for up to five additional years.

It is often referred to as permanent UK residency. As part of this you gain settled status and can apply for British citizenship via <a href="british-citizenship.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#274789;">naturalisation</span></a>.</p>\r\n<p>An application for permanent residency in the UK can be made by people who have previously been successful in applying for a UK visa in Britain in a category leading to settlement. These categories will say if they are or are not eligible and counted towards the right to remain.</p>\r\n<p>Global-Migrate can help you to obtain anything from a short-term visit visa through to long-term residency and citizenship. We handle everything and anything to do with UK immigration. You can find out whether you qualify by completing our online Indefinite Leave to Remain assessment form today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ILR Benefits</strong><br><br>\r\nA permanent resident visa for Great Britain has no time limit imposed upon it, and whereas a work permit would depend upon a specific offer of employment, there are no immigration related restrictions upon the type of work or business a person with a permanent UK resident status may undertake on arrival.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ILR Duration</strong><br><br>\r\nThere is no time limit; however, it is important to note that holders should not spend periods of more than two years outside of the United Kingdom. A long-term UK resident should consider the United Kingdom as home and spending only short periods of time in Britain may lead to the loss of ILR.<br>\r\nA person with ILR may be eligible to apply for British Naturalisation as a UK citizen, provided they meet the requirements for <a href="british-citizenship.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#274789;">British citizenship</span></a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Eligibility</strong><br><br>\r\nThe applicant must have a settled status in Britain. This usually means that the candidate must have been resident in Great Britain on the same visa class for at least four years. The only exception to this is for people on marriage visas or De Facto visas, who only require two years and for periods of exceptionally long-term residency (10 years legal, or 14 years as a combination of illegal and legal residency).</p>\r\n<p>Ancestry and being an EU National can be a way in, as can marriage. All applicants have to demonstrate sufficient understanding of the English language and the English way of life in order to qualify.</p>\r\n<p>Global-Migrate can make an application for you Indefinite Leave to Remain (Also known as the ILR) using one of our premium services, which means that you will have your passport back within 24 hours.

The Immigrant Investor Program is currently on hold until further notice, although some investor visas are available through the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program.<br><br>\r\nApplications made before 1 July 2012 will still be processed, though. For these applications, you will need to show that you have suitable business experience along with sufficient funds to invest.<br><br>\r\nFor these applications, you will need a net worth of at least C$1,600,000, and make a C$800,000 investment. The investment is administered by Canadian immigration, and is used to improve the economy of the Canadian provinces.<br><br>\r\nOnce the investment is made, you will be granted a permanent residency visa. The original investment is returned to you, without interest, after around five years and three months. The processing time does vary, and Global-Migrate’s Canadian immigration consultants can give you the most up-to-date information.<br><br>\r\nAlthough this visa category is currently on hold, there are plenty of other ways for skilled business people to migrate to Canada. To find out about alternatives to the Investor visa, call, email, or request a call back from Global-Migrate today.<br><br>\r\nWe have years of experience helping people make their Canadian immigration dream a reality.

This settlement path, called long residence, granted indefinite leave to remain to migrants who had resided in the UK continuously for 10 or 14 years, depending on the specific circumstances.<br><br>\r\nBecause of changing immigration rules, it is important to speak to a qualified immigration advisor before applying for a long-term residency settlement. Global-Migrate’s advisors are trained and can help you prepare an application based on the current rules.<br><br>\r\nBefore 9 July 2012, long residence was granted after 14 years of continuous residence. If an application was made before that date, it will still be considered under the previous rules.<br><br>\r\nApplications made after 9 July 2012, however, are judged by the new rules. Call Global-Migrate to find out what rules will be used to judge your application, and to get an assessment of your case.<br><br>\r\nThe current immigration rules will allow settlement after 10 years of continuous lawful residence. This means that you will have to have been in the UK for that period of time, and that you did not breach the terms of your visa at any point. You must also meet language and life requirements, as you would for any settlement visa.<br><br>\r\nIf you have been in the UK for 10 years, there is no limit as to when you can apply for settlement. After 10 years you become eligible, and remain eligible. However, your case will be judged by the rules in effect at the time of your application. If you wait to apply, the rules are subject to change.<br><br>\r\nGlobal-Migrate helps hundreds of people every year who want to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom. Our team of experienced advisors can help you figure out if your application will be successful. If we believe your application will be successful, we can help you through the entire application process.<br><br>\r\nTo find out more about long term residency, and the current requirements, get in touch with us today.\r\n</p></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <td align="left">  <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php"> <div class="more"></div></a></td>\r\n                  <td align="right"><table width="157" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0">\r\n          <tbody><tr>\r\n             <td width="10">&nbsp;</td> \r\n            <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td width="36"></td>\r\n            <td width="34"></td>\r\n            <td width="41"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </tbody></table></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </table>', 'Long Term Residency', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '193-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-07 07:44:06', '2014-03-07 07:44:06', '', 193, 'http://www.global-migrate.com/193-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Australia has a history of employing high quality skilled workers, especially from countries like the UK. All skilled workers get rewarded in the form of high salaries, career growth and stability. Workers from different kind of trades, including Carpenters, Plumbers, Welders, Floor tilers, Mechanics, Electricians, IT consultants, Teachers, Accountants migrate to Australia every day, every week, every month. Global Migrate is proud to be a part of their journey.<br><br>\r\nThe three options available for Skilled Immigration to Australia are;\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n</p><h4>Skilled Independent Visa - (Subclass 189)</h4>\r\n<p>The Skilled Independent visa is a points-based application. To qualify for the independent visa, you must first meet basic requirements around your age, English competence, training and work experience. Once you meet these requirements, you will be eligible for this visa. This visa is without a doubt the most desired route of immigration to Australia; however, you need to score very high points to be able to apply for this visa. This is an independent application which means no state, or territory will sponsor you and you need to score the required points without having to claim any bonus points for sponsorship.<br>\r\n<strong><a style="color:#0033CC" href="skilled-subclass-189.html">Read More…</a></strong></p>\r\n<h4>Skilled Nominated Visa &ndash; (Subclass 190)</h4>\r\n<p>The Skilled Sponsored visa is a points-based application. To qualify for this type of visa you must first meet basic requirements around your age, English competence, training and work experience. Once you meet these requirements you may be eligible for this visa. Once approved you become a permanent resident of Australia from day one however you have a restriction to your stay in Australia, where you need to live in the region that sponsors your occupation for at least 24 months.<br>\r\n<strong><a style="color:#0033CC" href="skilled-subclass-190.html">Read More…</a></strong></p>\r\n<h4>Skilled Nominated or Sponsored Visa &ndash; (Subclass 489) </h4>\r\n<p>The Skilled Regional Sponsored visa is initially based on meeting a point score. To qualify for this visa, you must first pass basic requirements. You get points for your age, English competence, training, work experience and having an eligible relative (or a state) able to sponsor you. Once you meet these requirements, you may be eligible for this type of visa.

There are different applications depending on whether your family members are already in Canada, or if they are currently living outside of Canada. Global-Migrate can help you determine which type of application you will need to make.<br><br>\r\nThe second half of the process is your family member’s application for permanent residence. Global-Migrate has helped many families with their Canadian migration, and we have a very high success rate. Our trained advisors are able to help you with each part of the complex and often confusing process.<br><br>\r\nFamily sponsorship is currently limited to spouses, partners, and children. For Canadian immigration purposes, spouses include those who have a legitimate marriage, including same-sex marriages. Partners include common-law and conjugal partners, in either different-sex or same-sex relationships. <br><br>\r\nFor applications made after 25 October 2012, you will need to live together for two years from the day your partner’s permanent residency was granted. There are some exceptions to this new rule, and Global-Migrate’s team of advisors can give you the most up-to-date information.\r\nGlobal-Migrate can also help you find out whether your children or other dependents under the age of 18 are eligible to be sponsored.

The permit grants them a UK visa on the basis that they have a job offer and meet a number of skill requirements.<p></p>\r\n<p>At Global-Migrate we provide a tailor made service designed to assist these highly skilled individuals to get a successful outcome of their visa.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits of a Tier 2 visa</h4>\r\nTier 2 immigration is a UK visa which offers a possibility of permanent residency in the UK to highly skilled foreign nationals. It allows large organisations to transfer the skills of new and existing staff members from outside the UK into this country.<p></p>\r\n<p>The Tier 2 work permit visas can last between one day and five years, depending on the time frame specified by the sponsoring company. Although the Tier 2 permit is not a permanent residency visa, those who do live and work in the UK for a minimum of five years on this permit may apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK. Once they have completed a year on the ILR category they may be eligible for British Citizenship through the Naturalisation route</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThis application is a point’s based visa. Tier 2 visa applicants are assessed based on potential Earnings, English language skills and available funds to support their stay in the UK.<p></p>\r\n<p>It is the employer’s responsibility to make sure that a candidate is eligible and suitable. Immigration compliance checks can be carried out and require no notice. Employers will be awarded a sponsorship license, according to the UK Border Agency’s risk assessment. Pay must be fair and equal to what a UK national would earn in that role, and the role must be above NVQ level 3. Applications for spouse and dependents may be made in conjunction with a Tier 2 permit due to the potential settlement that could follow such a visa. For more information please use the FREE online assessment tool and receive expert professional help.</p>\r\n <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php"> <div class="more"></div></a>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Tier 2 Change of Employment</h4>\r\nTier 2 immigration candidates are sponsored by an employer as part of gaining their permit to work in the UK as a highly skilled worker. However, candidates can change their employment whilst in the UK, but they must obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship once again and they must be reassessed against the points test.<p></p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Duration</h4>\r\nThe change of employer requires a new sponsorship, therefore it is classified as a new permit and means you can work for a period of one to five years all over again, depending on the sponsor’s contract offer duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>The duration is also at the discretion of the Home Office and these changes are temporary immigration services, not a route to settlement. Settlement can be pursued after five years, though. Due to the temporary nature, you do not have the freedom to work in the UK aside this agreed role.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThe position for which the change of employment working visa is being sought must meet National Vocation Qualification (NVQ) level 3 or above, as the original application for a Tier 2 permit did. If the candidate in question works in a specific profession, they may be required to register with the relevant governing body.<p></p>\r\n<p>A candidate applying for a permit to work in the UK must possess a relevant degree or a non-relevant degree plus a year’s experience. The same can apply to a HND level qualification and again, if irrelevant then there must be a year’s relevant work experience alongside it. A candidate can be eligible with no degree if they have three years of relevant experience.</p>\r\n<p>If a position is listed on the UK shortage list then the employer does not need to advertise the vacancy before sponsoring an applicant. They must prove an attempt to recruit from within the UK and EU workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Global-Migrate can help make sure that your company abides by all the relevant rules and regulations in applying for a Tier 2 permit. With our experienced staff and their prior knowledge of immigration and employment law, we can make this process as smooth as possible, all by using our FREE online assessment tool.</p>\r\n <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php"> <div class="more"></div></a>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Tier 2 Intra Company Transfer</h4>\r\nIntra-Company Transfers (ICTs) allow multi-national employers to transfer overseas employees to fill a specific position which they have been unable to fill from the local resident workforce. The Tier 2 permit in general allows non-citizens to work in the UK for a specific time period and role, as agreed by an employer. The company must prove that the employee is appropriately skilled, though.<p></p>\r\n<p>With Global-Migrate you can quickly discover what rules and regulations you need to be aware of and how to get the easiest application route sorted. Click the FREE online assessment tool below for more.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits</h4>\r\nThe main benefit of this type of UK immigration service is that an employer does not need to demonstrate that the position has been advertised before applying for an ICT. No points-based assessment is required either, however you will have to explain why the transfer is necessary and detail its duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>Like all Tier 2 permits, the application can last from a day to five years, depending on the sponsor company’s request, but is not intended as a route to settlement and at the expiry of the permit candidates will be expected to return to their former country.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nTo be eligible for the ICT visa service the position must warrant an NVQ level 3 or above, and the person must meet that criteria. Furthermore, if the candidate is a member of a specific profession they may be required to be registered with the appropriate governing body. In addition, a selected candidate must have a level of knowledge that is essential and relevant to the post.<p></p>\r\n<p>The employee for whom the ICT is being sought must have been employed by the overseas company for a period of six months or more prior to the application. Documentary evidence of this relationship must be produced before visas of this class can be issued.</p>\r\n<p>Partners and dependents can come over as well, and their length of stay will be in line with that of the permit length.

It allows large organisations to transfer the skills of new and existing staff members from outside the UK into this country.<p></p>\n<p>The Tier 2 work permit visas can last between one day and five years, depending on the time frame specified by the sponsoring company. Although the Tier 2 permit is not a permanent residency visa, those who do live and work in the UK for a minimum of five years on this permit may apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK. Once they have completed a year on the ILR category they may be eligible for British Citizenship through the Naturalisation route</p>\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\nThis application is a point’s based visa. Tier 2 visa applicants are assessed based on potential Earnings, English language skills and available funds to support their stay in the UK.<p></p>\n<p>It is the employer’s responsibility to make sure that a candidate is eligible and suitable. Immigration compliance checks can be carried out and require no notice. Employers will be awarded a sponsorship license, according to the UK Border Agency’s risk assessment. Pay must be fair and equal to what a UK national would earn in that role, and the role must be above NVQ level 3. Applications for spouse and dependents may be made in conjunction with a Tier 2 permit due to the potential settlement that could follow such a visa.

However, candidates can change their employment whilst in the UK, but they must obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship once again and they must be reassessed against the points test.<p></p>\n<p></p><h4>Duration</h4>\nThe change of employer requires a new sponsorship, therefore it is classified as a new permit and means you can work for a period of one to five years all over again, depending on the sponsor’s contract offer duration.<p></p>\n<p>The duration is also at the discretion of the Home Office and these changes are temporary immigration services, not a route to settlement. Settlement can be pursued after five years, though. Due to the temporary nature, you do not have the freedom to work in the UK aside this agreed role.</p>\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\nThe position for which the change of employment working visa is being sought must meet National Vocation Qualification (NVQ) level 3 or above, as the original application for a Tier 2 permit did. If the candidate in question works in a specific profession, they may be required to register with the relevant governing body.<p></p>\n<p>A candidate applying for a permit to work in the UK must possess a relevant degree or a non-relevant degree plus a year’s experience. The same can apply to a HND level qualification and again, if irrelevant then there must be a year’s relevant work experience alongside it. A candidate can be eligible with no degree if they have three years of relevant experience.</p>\n<p>If a position is listed on the UK shortage list then the employer does not need to advertise the vacancy before sponsoring an applicant. They must prove an attempt to recruit from within the UK and EU workforce.</p>\n<p>Global-Migrate can help make sure that your company abides by all the relevant rules and regulations in applying for a Tier 2 permit. With our experienced staff and their prior knowledge of immigration and employment law, we can make this process as smooth as possible, all by using our FREE online assessment tool.</p>\n<a class="more" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php" title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment"></a>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p><h4>Tier 2 Intra Company Transfer</h4>\nIntra-Company Transfers (ICTs) allow multi-national employers to transfer overseas employees to fill a specific position which they have been unable to fill from the local resident workforce. The Tier 2 permit in general allows non-citizens to work in the UK for a specific time period and role, as agreed by an employer. The company must prove that the employee is appropriately skilled, though.<p></p>\n<p>With Global-Migrate you can quickly discover what rules and regulations you need to be aware of and how to get the easiest application route sorted. Click the FREE online assessment tool below for more.</p>\n<p></p><h4>Benefits</h4>\nThe main benefit of this type of UK immigration service is that an employer does not need to demonstrate that the position has been advertised before applying for an ICT. No points-based assessment is required either, however you will have to explain why the transfer is necessary and detail its duration.<p></p>\n<p>Like all Tier 2 permits, the application can last from a day to five years, depending on the sponsor company’s request, but is not intended as a route to settlement and at the expiry of the permit candidates will be expected to return to their former country.</p>\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\nTo be eligible for the ICT visa service the position must warrant an NVQ level 3 or above, and the person must meet that criteria. Furthermore, if the candidate is a member of a specific profession they may be required to be registered with the appropriate governing body. In addition, a selected candidate must have a level of knowledge that is essential and relevant to the post.<p></p>\n<p>The employee for whom the ICT is being sought must have been employed by the overseas company for a period of six months or more prior to the application. Documentary evidence of this relationship must be produced before visas of this class can be issued.</p>\n<p>Partners and dependents can come over as well, and their length of stay will be in line with that of the permit length.

The permit grants them a UK visa on the basis that they have a job offer and meet a number of skill requirements.<p></p>\r\n<p>At Global-Migrate we provide a tailor made service designed to assist these highly skilled individuals to get a successful outcome of their visa.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits of a Tier 2 visa</h4>\r\nTier 2 immigration is a UK visa which offers a possibility of permanent residency in the UK to highly skilled foreign nationals. It allows large organisations to transfer the skills of new and existing staff members from outside the UK into this country.<p></p>\r\n<p>The Tier 2 work permit visas can last between one day and five years, depending on the time frame specified by the sponsoring company. Although the Tier 2 permit is not a permanent residency visa, those who do live and work in the UK for a minimum of five years on this permit may apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK. Once they have completed a year on the ILR category they may be eligible for British Citizenship through the Naturalisation route</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThis application is a point’s based visa. Tier 2 visa applicants are assessed based on potential Earnings, English language skills and available funds to support their stay in the UK.<p></p>\r\n<p>It is the employer’s responsibility to make sure that a candidate is eligible and suitable. Immigration compliance checks can be carried out and require no notice. Employers will be awarded a sponsorship license, according to the UK Border Agency’s risk assessment. Pay must be fair and equal to what a UK national would earn in that role, and the role must be above NVQ level 3. Applications for spouse and dependents may be made in conjunction with a Tier 2 permit due to the potential settlement that could follow such a visa.

However, candidates can change their employment whilst in the UK, but they must obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship once again and they must be reassessed against the points test.<p></p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Duration</h4>\r\nThe change of employer requires a new sponsorship, therefore it is classified as a new permit and means you can work for a period of one to five years all over again, depending on the sponsor’s contract offer duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>The duration is also at the discretion of the Home Office and these changes are temporary immigration services, not a route to settlement. Settlement can be pursued after five years, though. Due to the temporary nature, you do not have the freedom to work in the UK aside this agreed role.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThe position for which the change of employment working visa is being sought must meet National Vocation Qualification (NVQ) level 3 or above, as the original application for a Tier 2 permit did. If the candidate in question works in a specific profession, they may be required to register with the relevant governing body.<p></p>\r\n<p>A candidate applying for a permit to work in the UK must possess a relevant degree or a non-relevant degree plus a year’s experience. The same can apply to a HND level qualification and again, if irrelevant then there must be a year’s relevant work experience alongside it. A candidate can be eligible with no degree if they have three years of relevant experience.</p>\r\n<p>If a position is listed on the UK shortage list then the employer does not need to advertise the vacancy before sponsoring an applicant.

The permit grants them a UK visa on the basis that they have a job offer and meet a number of skill requirements.<p></p>\r\n<p>At Global-Migrate we provide a tailor made service designed to assist these highly skilled individuals to get a successful outcome of their visa.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits of a Tier 2 visa</h4>\r\nTier 2 immigration is a UK visa which offers a possibility of permanent residency in the UK to highly skilled foreign nationals. It allows large organisations to transfer the skills of new and existing staff members from outside the UK into this country.<p></p>\r\n<p>The Tier 2 work permit visas can last between one day and five years, depending on the time frame specified by the sponsoring company. Although the Tier 2 permit is not a permanent residency visa, those who do live and work in the UK for a minimum of five years on this permit may apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK. Once they have completed a year on the ILR category they may be eligible for British Citizenship through the Naturalisation route</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThis application is a point’s based visa. Tier 2 visa applicants are assessed based on potential Earnings, English language skills and available funds to support their stay in the UK.<p></p>\r\n<p>It is the employer’s responsibility to make sure that a candidate is eligible and suitable. Immigration compliance checks can be carried out and require no notice. Employers will be awarded a sponsorship license, according to the UK Border Agency’s risk assessment. Pay must be fair and equal to what a UK national would earn in that role, and the role must be above NVQ level 3. Applications for spouse and dependents may be made in conjunction with a Tier 2 permit due to the potential settlement that could follow such a visa.

However, candidates can change their employment whilst in the UK, but they must obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship once again and they must be reassessed against the points test.<p></p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Duration</h4>\r\nThe change of employer requires a new sponsorship, therefore it is classified as a new permit and means you can work for a period of one to five years all over again, depending on the sponsor’s contract offer duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>The duration is also at the discretion of the Home Office and these changes are temporary immigration services, not a route to settlement. Settlement can be pursued after five years, though. Due to the temporary nature, you do not have the freedom to work in the UK aside this agreed role.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThe position for which the change of employment working visa is being sought must meet National Vocation Qualification (NVQ) level 3 or above, as the original application for a Tier 2 permit did. If the candidate in question works in a specific profession, they may be required to register with the relevant governing body.<p></p>\r\n<p>A candidate applying for a permit to work in the UK must possess a relevant degree or a non-relevant degree plus a year’s experience. The same can apply to a HND level qualification and again, if irrelevant then there must be a year’s relevant work experience alongside it. A candidate can be eligible with no degree if they have three years of relevant experience.</p>\r\n<p>If a position is listed on the UK shortage list then the employer does not need to advertise the vacancy before sponsoring an applicant. They must prove an attempt to recruit from within the UK and EU workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Global-Migrate can help make sure that your company abides by all the relevant rules and regulations in applying for a Tier 2 permit. With our experienced staff and their prior knowledge of immigration and employment law, we can make this process as smooth as possible, all by using our FREE online assessment tool.</p>\r\n <td align="left">  <a title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php"> <div class="more"></div></a></td>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Tier 2 Intra Company Transfer</h4>\r\nIntra-Company Transfers (ICTs) allow multi-national employers to transfer overseas employees to fill a specific position which they have been unable to fill from the local resident workforce. The Tier 2 permit in general allows non-citizens to work in the UK for a specific time period and role, as agreed by an employer. The company must prove that the employee is appropriately skilled, though.<p></p>\r\n<p>With Global-Migrate you can quickly discover what rules and regulations you need to be aware of and how to get the easiest application route sorted. Click the FREE online assessment tool below for more.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits</h4>\r\nThe main benefit of this type of UK immigration service is that an employer does not need to demonstrate that the position has been advertised before applying for an ICT. No points-based assessment is required either, however you will have to explain why the transfer is necessary and detail its duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>Like all Tier 2 permits, the application can last from a day to five years, depending on the sponsor company’s request, but is not intended as a route to settlement and at the expiry of the permit candidates will be expected to return to their former country.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nTo be eligible for the ICT visa service the position must warrant an NVQ level 3 or above, and the person must meet that criteria. Furthermore, if the candidate is a member of a specific profession they may be required to be registered with the appropriate governing body. In addition, a selected candidate must have a level of knowledge that is essential and relevant to the post.<p></p>\r\n<p>The employee for whom the ICT is being sought must have been employed by the overseas company for a period of six months or more prior to the application. Documentary evidence of this relationship must be produced before visas of this class can be issued.</p>\r\n<p>Partners and dependents can come over as well, and their length of stay will be in line with that of the permit length.

The applicant may come to the UK in the capacity of a monk, nun, priest or a member of similar religious community. This will entitle the candidate to stay in the country for a maximum of 3 years. The employer must possess a Tier 2 sponsorship license.<p></p>\r\n<p>With Global-Migrate you can quickly discover what rules and regulations you need to be aware of and how to get the your application or a Tier 2 Minister of Religion initiated.

Each year, people come from all over the world to study at these academic institutions. For those coming from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), a Tier 4 Student Visa is required.<br><br>\r\nTo get a Tier 4 visa, you need to have an offer to study at an approved institution. Each institution will have its own admission requirements that you must meet in order to receive the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS).<br><br>\r\nThe UK Border Agency regularly updates the list of institutions that are allowed to sponsor overseas students. Global Migrate can advise you on whether your institution is on the list or not.<br><br>\r\nYou will also need to show that you have enough money to support yourself during your studies. This is calculated using a points-based system. The total amount you must be able to show will vary depending on the place and type of study you are undertaking.<br><br>\r\nOverseas students do pay higher fees than UK students. The cost of courses can range from £7,000 per year to £18,000 per year. The cost of living during studies can also vary, with London being much higher than other parts of the country. <br><br>\r\nTo get a clear understanding of how much you will need, and how you will need to prove it, contact Global Migrate’s trained advisors.<br><br>\r\nA Tier 4 visa does have limitations on it. Because the purpose of your stay is to study, you will have limits on how much you can work each week. You might also have limits on the type of jobs you may take.<br><br>\r\nIf you are applying for a Tier 4 visa, you might be able to bring your family with you. Get in touch with a Global migrate advisor to find out more about the requirements for families under Tier 4 visas.<br><br>\r\nStudying in the UK can be a very exciting and fulfilling thing, so don’t let the visa process stop you.

The permit grants them a UK visa on the basis that they have a job offer and meet a number of skill requirements.<p></p>\r\n<p>At Global-Migrate we provide a tailor made service designed to assist these highly skilled individuals to get a successful outcome of their visa.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits of a Tier 2 visa</h4>\r\nTier 2 immigration is a UK visa which offers a possibility of permanent residency in the UK to highly skilled foreign nationals. It allows large organisations to transfer the skills of new and existing staff members from outside the UK into this country.<p></p>\r\n<p>The Tier 2 work permit visas can last between one day and five years, depending on the time frame specified by the sponsoring company. Although the Tier 2 permit is not a permanent residency visa, those who do live and work in the UK for a minimum of five years on this permit may apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK. Once they have completed a year on the ILR category they may be eligible for British Citizenship through the Naturalisation route</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThis application is a point’s based visa. Tier 2 visa applicants are assessed based on potential Earnings, English language skills and available funds to support their stay in the UK.<p></p>\r\n<p>It is the employer’s responsibility to make sure that a candidate is eligible and suitable. Immigration compliance checks can be carried out and require no notice. Employers will be awarded a sponsorship license, according to the UK Border Agency’s risk assessment. Pay must be fair and equal to what a UK national would earn in that role, and the role must be above NVQ level 3. Applications for spouse and dependents may be made in conjunction with a Tier 2 permit due to the potential settlement that could follow such a visa. For more information please use the FREE online assessment tool and receive expert professional help.</p>\r\n  <a class="more" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php" title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment"></a>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Tier 2 Change of Employment</h4>\r\nTier 2 immigration candidates are sponsored by an employer as part of gaining their permit to work in the UK as a highly skilled worker. However, candidates can change their employment whilst in the UK, but they must obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship once again and they must be reassessed against the points test.<p></p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Duration</h4>\r\nThe change of employer requires a new sponsorship, therefore it is classified as a new permit and means you can work for a period of one to five years all over again, depending on the sponsor’s contract offer duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>The duration is also at the discretion of the Home Office and these changes are temporary immigration services, not a route to settlement. Settlement can be pursued after five years, though. Due to the temporary nature, you do not have the freedom to work in the UK aside this agreed role.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nThe position for which the change of employment working visa is being sought must meet National Vocation Qualification (NVQ) level 3 or above, as the original application for a Tier 2 permit did. If the candidate in question works in a specific profession, they may be required to register with the relevant governing body.<p></p>\r\n<p>A candidate applying for a permit to work in the UK must possess a relevant degree or a non-relevant degree plus a year’s experience. The same can apply to a HND level qualification and again, if irrelevant then there must be a year’s relevant work experience alongside it. A candidate can be eligible with no degree if they have three years of relevant experience.</p>\r\n<p>If a position is listed on the UK shortage list then the employer does not need to advertise the vacancy before sponsoring an applicant. They must prove an attempt to recruit from within the UK and EU workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Global-Migrate can help make sure that your company abides by all the relevant rules and regulations in applying for a Tier 2 permit. With our experienced staff and their prior knowledge of immigration and employment law, we can make this process as smooth as possible, all by using our FREE online assessment tool.</p>\r\n<a class="more" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php" title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment"></a>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Tier 2 Intra Company Transfer</h4>\r\nIntra-Company Transfers (ICTs) allow multi-national employers to transfer overseas employees to fill a specific position which they have been unable to fill from the local resident workforce. The Tier 2 permit in general allows non-citizens to work in the UK for a specific time period and role, as agreed by an employer. The company must prove that the employee is appropriately skilled, though.<p></p>\r\n<p>With Global-Migrate you can quickly discover what rules and regulations you need to be aware of and how to get the easiest application route sorted. Click the FREE online assessment tool below for more.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>Benefits</h4>\r\nThe main benefit of this type of UK immigration service is that an employer does not need to demonstrate that the position has been advertised before applying for an ICT. No points-based assessment is required either, however you will have to explain why the transfer is necessary and detail its duration.<p></p>\r\n<p>Like all Tier 2 permits, the application can last from a day to five years, depending on the sponsor company’s request, but is not intended as a route to settlement and at the expiry of the permit candidates will be expected to return to their former country.</p>\r\n<p></p><h4>What criteria do you need to meet?</h4>\r\nTo be eligible for the ICT visa service the position must warrant an NVQ level 3 or above, and the person must meet that criteria. Furthermore, if the candidate is a member of a specific profession they may be required to be registered with the appropriate governing body. In addition, a selected candidate must have a level of knowledge that is essential and relevant to the post.<p></p>\r\n<p>The employee for whom the ICT is being sought must have been employed by the overseas company for a period of six months or more prior to the application. Documentary evidence of this relationship must be produced before visas of this class can be issued.</p>\r\n<p>Partners and dependents can come over as well, and their length of stay will be in line with that of the permit length.

The country consists of a large peninsula, Jutland and many islands, as well as hundreds of minor islands often referred to as the Danish Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenmark has recently become one of the most active members of the European Union which is giving Skilled foreign workers an opportunity to work in their country. Denmark’s immigration policy is very similar to the HSMP or the Tier 1 General category in the United Kingdom’s skilled immigration options which is not available to foreign nationals anymore. Denmark Immigration uses a point’s based system, namely, the Danish Green Card to attract foreign skilled workers to come work in the EU. Apart from this, Denmark also has a work permit system called the Positive List scheme which allows foreign nationals with a valid job offer from a Danish employer to work in Denmark.\r\n<h4>Green Card Scheme</h4>\r\nThe Greencard scheme allows you to work in Denmark without any restrictions. This is a points based application and you need to score a minimum of a 100 pints based on your age, education, language and work experience. A residence permit under the Greencard scheme gives you the right to carry out paid or unpaid work. However, the Ministry of Integration clearly specifies that this permit does not give you the right to work as a self-employed person i.e. you run your own business. You must also be able to prove that you can financially support yourself during your first year in Denmark.\r\n\r\n<strong><a style="color: #003399;" href="denmark-green-card.html">Read More...</a></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like many other countries in the EU Denmark also have a shortage of skilled occupation and many employers are currently looking for such skilled workers. If you have the skills from the positive list, you can obtain a work and residence permit in very little time under the Positive List scheme. Please call us on +44 (0)207 9934762 if you have an offer of employment.\r\n<h4>Study Visas</h4>\r\nAs a foreign national, you can be granted a residence permit in order to study in Denmark.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Nordic citizen, you are free to reside, study and work in Denmark.

When this is granted, you will be free to live and work in any part of Australia.\n\nThe Skilled Nominated or Sponsored Provisional Visa can be the ideal way for you to migrate to Australia.

The country’s points-based visa system allows certain skilled workers to gain permanent residency. One of the visas in this program is the Skilled Nominated, or subclass 190, Visa.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are thinking of applying for a Skilled Nominated Visa, get in touch with Global-Migrate today for a free visa assessment. Our qualified advisors can help determine if this is the right visa for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with all of Australia’s skilled worker visas, the subclass 190 visa does have some basic requirements. These include an English language requirement as well as an age requirement. If you’re under 50 and have the language ability, you can submit an expression of interest for a subclass 190 visa.&nbsp;\r\n <a class="more" title="Start Your Free Visa Assessment" href="http://www.global-migrate.com/free-assessment.php"> </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLike the other skilled worker visas, you will need to pass the points assessment for the Skilled Nominated visa. To find out about what can earn you points, and how many points you’ll need, speak to Global-Migrate’s MARA registered consultants. We have helped many people with their skilled immigration applications, and can help you with yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Skilled Nominated visa, you will also need a state or territory nomination. Some states and territories are in need of specific types of skilled workers. If you receive a nomination, you will need to settle in that state or territory. If you want to find out about the benefits, and limits, of a nomination speak to a Global-Migrate representative today.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subclass 190 visa can be a great way to migrate to Australia. If you qualify, it can give you and your spouse the ability to take up permanent residency in Australia, and can put you on the path to citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, as with any visa application, the Australian subclass 190 visa process can be confusing. Working with an experienced immigration advisor like global-Migrate can help ensure you’re submitting your application correctly.

There are many categories of visitors. A visitor is someone who generally intends to be in the UK for a short period, for example, to visit friends and family, to do business, to do a short course of study, to have private medical treatment. The information given here aims to deal with the various categories of visitors coming to the UK.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn general, you must show that:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n<li> you want to visit the UK for no more than six months;</li>\r\n<li>you intend to leave the UK at the end of your visit;</li>\r\n<li>you have enough money to support yourself during your stay in the UK without working or needing help from public funds.</li>\r\n<li>you do not intend to take paid or unpaid employment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nVisitors can stay in the UK for a maximum of six months at any one time. There are exceptions to this rule. Certain applicants can stay up to 12 months. They are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>academic visitors</li>\r\n<li>the parents of children at school</li>\r\n<li>visitors taking part in archaeological excavations</li>\r\n<li>visitors coming for private medical treatment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA general visit, business, entertainer or sports visit visa may be valid for 1, 2, 5 or 10 years. However, you are still only entitled to stay in the UK for a maximum of 180 days (6 months). A 2 year visit visa does not mean you are entitled to stay in the UK for 2 years, for example. We recommend that you limit your stay to the period stated on your visa application or to a maximum of 180 days within a 12 month period. Lengthy periods spent in the UK as a visitor may cause an immigration or visa officer to doubt your intentions. If you breach the conditions attached to your entry to the UK, you face a future ban of up to 10 years.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you want to come to the UK as a tourist or to visit friends you should apply as a general visitor. To visit the UK in this capacity you must be able to show that:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>you intend to visit the UK for no more than six months;</li>\r\n<li>you intend to leave the UK at the end of your visit, and</li>\r\n<li>you have enough money to support yourself and live in the UK without working or needing any help from public funds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWould you like to know if you qualify?

The application for an extension is often slightly different than for the original visa. However, you will still need to provide proof that you are eligible to be in the UK.<br><br>\r\nAt Global-Migrate, we have helped thousands of people extend their visa. To find out how we can help with your visa extension, call us today.<br><br>\r\n<strong>Tier 1 Extensions</strong><br><br>\r\nTo extend your stay on a Tier 1 visa, you will need to provide the same evidence that you did when you applied for your initial visa. Depending on which category of Tier 1 visa you hold, the rules for extensions have changed recently. Our visa assessment can help determine what extension options are available to you.<br><br>\r\n<strong>Tier 2 Extensions</strong><br><br>\r\nTo extend a Tier 2 visa, your employer will need to submit the application. In most cases, your initial visa will have been for 5 years, after which time you can apply for a settlement, or indefinite leave to remain, visa. If your visa was for less than 5 years, or you do not want to apply for settlement, you may be able to extend your Tier 2 visa. Global-Migrate can help you determine how best to extend your Tier 2 stay.<br><br>\r\n<strong>Tier 4 Extensions</strong><br><br>\r\nTo extend your Tier 4 visa, you will need to show that you are still enrolled at your academic institution. While your initial visa is granted for the entire time of your course, you might need to extend your stay if it is taking you longer to complete your course. If you have been accepted into another course, such as for a postgraduate degree, you might be able to apply for an extension from within the UK. Global-Migrate’s advisors can help determine your Tier 4 extension options.<br><br>\r\n<strong>Other categories</strong><br><br>\r\nIf you are in the UK on any other type of visa, you may still be able to extend your stay.

Immigration officers will look at things like past visa refusals, so if you have been refused a visa in the past, it is important that you are able to explain this in your application.

The spouse of the foreign national must already be settled in the UK, either as a British national or as a permanent resident.<br><br>\r\nTo be eligible for this type of visa, the foreign national and their spouse must be married or in a civil partnership.

Immigration officers will look at things like past visa refusals, so if you have been refused a visa in the past, it is important that you are able to explain this in your application. If you have had a refusal, we strongly advise that you speak to one of our case workers before you apply.<br><br>\r\nFiling the application for a marriage visa can be stressful, and requires a lot of documentation.

While the H-1B visas are limited each year, B-1 visas are not. This can make the B-1 in lieu of H-1B option very attractive. To find out if this is right for you, call Global-Migrate’s immigration advisors today.<br><br>\r\nH-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals working for American employers, while the B-1 visa is intended for business visitors to the United States. Unlike H-1B visa holders, B-1 visa holders cannot have any income from a US company, with the exception of certain expenses.<br><br>\r\nTo apply for a B-1 visa in lieu of an H-1B, you must meet certain criteria. These include a minimum of a degree equivalent to a US bachelor’s degree, and the intent to perform work at the level required for an H-1B visa.<br><br>\r\nThe visa application process can be complicated, particularly as you’ll need to prove that you do not intend to stay past the end of your visa, and that you will not be taking on employment with a US company. Speaking to one of Global-Migrate’strained consultants can help you with this difficult and confusing process.<br><br>\r\nIt is important to remember that there will be limits on what you can do during your stay in the US on a B-1 in lieu of H-1B visa. If you want to stay for a longer period of time, work for an American employer, or find out how you can bring your family with you, speak to Global-Migrate about other US visa options.<br><br>\r\nWorking in the United States can be a great experience for you.

To find out about working visa options, contact Global-Migrate today.<br><br>\r\nAs part of your B-1 visa application, you will need to demonstrate that your stay in the US is temporary. In order to prove this, you will have to show that you have significant ties outside of the US, that you have sufficient funds for your travel, and that you have plans to leave the US.<br><br>\r\nWhen you apply, you will also need to attend an embassy interview. Global-Migrate can help you prepare for this interview, and can help you with all the parts of your application. If you represent a company that needs visas for multiple employees, we are able to give you advice about what the US Business Visa Center or Embassy Business Facilitation services can provide.<br><br>\r\nThe United States is full of business opportunities, and travelling to America can help you in your career.

The employment-based visas are limited to approximately 140,000 per year, and are split into five categories. Around 40,000 of these visas are given to those in the Second Preference, or E2, category. This type of visa is for those who hold advanced degrees or have exceptional abilities.<br><br>\r\nFor US immigration, a professional holding an advanced degree requires that you hold a degree beyond a baccalaureate degree. You may also qualify if you have a baccalaureate degree and at least five years of experience in your field. If you don’t meet this qualification, you may still be eligible for a different visa category. To ensure that you’re applying for the right type of visa, call our trained immigration advisors today.<br><br>\r\nA person of exceptional ability can also apply for an E2 visa. If you are a professional with expertise in your field beyond that ordinarily encountered, you might qualify. This can be in the sciences, arts, or business.<br><br>\r\nWith so many people applying for a limited number of visas, it is important to speak to a qualified immigration advisor. Global-Migrate can offer you a free immigration assessment to help determine if an E2 visa is right for you.<br><br>\r\nTo qualify for an E2 visa, you will generally need to have a labour certification as well as a job offer. Your US employer must file a petition on your behalf. If you don’t have these, you can apply for an exemption, though you will have to demonstrate that your migration would be in the national interest.<br><br>\r\nFor more details about these requirements, or how to get an exemption, get in touch with Global-Migrate’s team of qualified immigration advisors today.

This visa is part of the Employment-Based Immigration category, and is also known as the Employment Fifth Preference. To find out more about this category and get a free visa assessment, call or email Global-Migrate today.<br><br>\r\nThe EB-5 is a visa for Immigrant Investors. It is designed to allow for capital investment in the United States. The goal of this visa is to encourage investment in new commercial enterprises that will create jobs in the US.<br><br>\r\nThese visas are extremely limited, with less than 10,000 available each year. Unlike many other employment based categories, the immigrant investor visa does not require a labour certification.<br><br>\r\nThe EB-5 visa can be a difficult application, so it is important to get high quality advice from trained immigration professionals. Global-Migrate can give you a free visa assessment to help determine the best way to make your US immigration dreams come true.<br><br>\r\nAn Immigrant Investor visa can be a great way for you to migrate to the United States and be a valuable part of the American economy. The visa category is divided into four sub-categories.

It can allow you to migrate while keeping your existing job, and lacks many of the limitations of other employer-based visas.

I was so impressed by the time and effort Adam made to make sure I understood the enitre visa process in detail that I did not hesitate to use their services and I can now say that I did not make the wrong decision.

When we spoke to Global-Migrate for the first time, they arranged a face-to-face consultation with one of there very experienced Canadian case worker. We had a free initial consultation which lasted approximately 40 minutes and we were so impressed by the professionalism of the case worker that we had to hire them immediately.

I had just got married to my long time partner who is an Australian Citizen. I was very scared at the beginning as I did not want my visa to be rejected. I spoke to many consultants who, by the sound of it, were only interested in my money. When I spoke to Adam at Global-Migrate he spent time explaining the benefits and advantaged of using their company. I was very happy to find out that they hired a MARA agent. I was so impressed by the time and effort Adam made to make sure I understood the enitre visa process in detail that I did not hesitate to use their services and I can now say that I did not make the wrong decision. I was kept up to date with my application process and at not at any point did it seem to me that I was wasting my money.

Me and my partner had been thinking of migrating to Canada for quite some time and were looking for a professional organisation to assist us with this application. When we spoke to Global-Migrate for the first time, they arranged a face-to-face consultation with one of there very experienced Canadian case worker. We had a free initial consultation which lasted approximately 40 minutes and we were so impressed by the professionalism of the case worker that we had to hire them immediately. The entire application took almost a year to be granted and we were so satisfied with the assistance we received that we have recommended at least 3 other family members to Global-Migrate ever since. Highly recommended.</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="justify"><strong>Mr. Ahmed W Bhatti, Lahore, Pakistan – 2011:</strong> <em>It was a hard decision to use someone who was based in another country, but after speaking to Global-Migrate consultants I was very satisfied and confident that my application will be in safe hands.

My Tier 1 General application was a bit complex as I was claiming income through self employment and employment. I spoke to many company who were quoting me very high fees due to the complexity of my case. Global-Migrate consultants were very helpful throughout the case. Once I had paid them my fee there customer service was even better and that showed that they were not interested in my money only. My application was successful and I thank Global-Migrate for being so helpful. </em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="justify"><strong>Miss Samantha Collins, Toronto, Canada – 2011:</strong> <em>I applied for an Australian Skilled Visa through Global-Migrate. I was very skeptical with which consultant I would use for my visa as Australian Immigration was a very lenghty and costly process. There are many bogus consultants out there who charge thousands of pounds but never produce any result. It took me 2 weeks to make a decision but in the end I went with Global-Migrate as their team came across very professional, they have a MARA regsitered agent in their team and the fee they were charging me was not as high as many other agents out there. They assisted me throughout the entire process and in about 16 months my application was approved. I am not planning on moving to Australia ASAP. I am glad I chose Global-Migrate in the end. </em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="justify"><strong>Mrs. Mandisa Abrahams, Buffalo City, South Africa - 2011:</strong> <em>My Grand parents were born in the UK and I knew I could apply for a UK Ancestry visa so I contacted Global-Migrate because I saw on there Website that they worked on a No Visa No fee policy. I did come across other companies in South Africa who claimed that they were big and well renowned but once I searched on the Internet they did not have many positive reviews so I decided to use Global-Migrate and do not regret using there service.

The most commonly spoken language in Australia is English, and the most commonly practiced religion is Christianity, although foreign languages and other religions are also common.\n\nAustralian Immigration can be quite a complex and a time consuming process, therefore, we strongly advise you to seek assistance from people in the know how. A regulated consultancy who hires a MARA agent like us is definitely a good option.
