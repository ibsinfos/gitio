						<h3 class="heading">How does this work?</h3>
						<p class="paragraph">Simply register by clicking the 'Sign Up' button below. Once you have confirmed your details, you can then search for a tutor based on grade and subject, as well as the date and time. You can also find tutors for extra-curricular activities under the 'Grade' tab. When you find a great tutor, you then book and pay for the session. Once your session finishes, we encourage you to rate your tutor as well as provide a short performance review.</p>

					<h3 class="heading">How do I search for a tutor using Insta-tute?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">You can search for a tutor on our Search Tutor page. Just enter the grade, subject, day and preferred session time, and then click 'Search'. We also offer an advanced search function that allows you to specify the tutor's maximum rate, whether you would like them to come to you (a surcharge may apply as determined by the tutor), and if you require them to have a Working With Children Check (WWC). If you are under 18, this is automatically enabled. Lastly, all tutors who teach students under 18 must hold a WWC so you can be confident about your tutor's background.</p>

					<h3 class="heading">Rating and reviewing your tutor</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">This is what sets us apart from everyone else!</p>
					<p class="paragraph">When you have completed your session with your tutor, we encourage you to rate them and fill in a short review. This provides immediate feedback to your tutor, and will allow them to improve their teaching as well as reflect on their performance. You will also receive a status point which will get you closer to attaining your next level!</p>
					
					<div class="border_bottom"></div>
					<h3 class="heading">What does a tutor's status mean?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">This represents a number of hours a tutor has taught with Insta-tute. Tutors receive status after they have the following experience:</p>
					<h4><span style="color:#7E6F42;">Bronze Status:</span>50 - 100 Hours</h4>
					<h4><span style="color:#D1CDCD;">Silver Status:</span>101 - 250 Hours</h4>
					<h4><span style="color:#C1AC52;">Gold Status:</span>251 - 1000 Hours</h4>
					<h4><span style="color:#6F6F6F;">Platinum:</span> 1001 Hours +</h4>
					
					<div class="border_bottom"></div>
					<h3 class="heading">What is a 'Favourite' tutor?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">If you find that your tutor is exceptional and you want to reserve more sessions with them, you can add them to your Favourite Tutor list. Once a tutor is added to the list, you'll be able to quickly access their calendar and book directly with them. We would also love to hear about your great experience with your tutor, so please contact us and let us know!</p>
					
					<div class="border_bottom"></div>
					<h3 class="heading">What if I can't make my lesson?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">If your session is more than 72 hours away, you can cancel your session via the app or website. Simply find the booking you wish to cancel in 'Upcoming Sessions', click on 'cancel booking' then on 'ok'. There is a cancellation penalty of $10 that applies to cover ours and our tutor's costs. If the session is within 72 hours, unfortunately it cannot be cancelled.</p>
					
					<div class="border_bottom"></div>
					<h3 class="heading">What if I have a problem with my tutor?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">If you're not satisfied with your session, you can lodge a dispute. You will need to go to 'Previous sessions' and click on the 'Dispute' button next to that. You then have an opportunity to outline why you were not satisfied with the tutor. Insta-tute will then investigate by speaking to all involved parties. We will keep you updated as to the process and outcome.</p>
