Please check our website regularly to ensure you are aware of any changes. We will endeavour to highlight any significant or substantive changes to you where possible. If you choose to use our website, then we will regard that use as conclusive evidence of your agreement and acceptance that these terms govern our liabilities, rights and obligations to and between each other.</p>

                <p class="grey-text">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
                <p class="paragraph_privacy">By using our website, and subject at all times to the application of the Australian Consumer Law, you agree that we will not  be liable to you for any loss or damage you might suffer or incur directly or indirectly from the services provided by us, including losses arising from errors or omissions in documents or information provided by us, or services we offer you. This includes your use or reliance on any third party content, links, comments or advertisements. Your use of, or reliance on, any information or materials on this website is entirely at your own risk, for which we shall not be liable.

                <p class="paragraph_privacy">You acknowledge and agree that the service we provide to you is to locate and recommend a tutor for your specific tuition requirements. By recommending a tutor to you, we do not in any way represent that the skills of a particular tutor will match your exact requirements. Our service is limited to matching the skills of a tutor that has been provided to us, with the skill-set that you inform us is required for your tuition needs. We do not have any control over a tutor's personality, style or quality of tuition and as such cannot warrant those matters, nor can we accept any liability to refund our fee to you unless the tutor we supply to you is manifestly inadequate or under qualified and not suitable to your requirements. If, within 48 hours after the completion of any tuition session, you do not inform us in writing that you have a complaint or grievance about a tutor, you are deemed to have accepted the quality and adequacy of the tutor's services in full.
